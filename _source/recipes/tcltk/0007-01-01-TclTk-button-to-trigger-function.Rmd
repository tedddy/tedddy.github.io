The following R code maps the `OK` button of a Tk toplevel window to a R function which displays a message box. We give a minimum size of six characters for the button (by using a negative value for its `width`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tcltk2)

pressedOK <- function()
  tkmessageBox(message = "You pressed OK!")

win1 <- tktoplevel()	# Create a new Tk window
win1$env$butOK <- tk2button(win1, text = "OK", width = -6, command = pressedOK)
tkgrid(win1$env$butOK, padx = 20, pady = 15)		# Place the button on the window
```

The toplevel window is shown below. We have not given it a title (using `tktitle()` or `tkwm.title()`), so the title bar displays the Tcl ID for this window, which is `1` in this case.

![OK button]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/button.png)

The result of pressing OK is shown below:

![OK button pressed]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/button2.png)

To close the tk window from within R, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tkdestroy(win1)       # Kill the 'win1' Tk window
```
