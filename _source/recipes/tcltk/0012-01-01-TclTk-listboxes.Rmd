The following examples illustrate how to use a list box in a Tk window. The first example does not have a scrollbar, so it is simpler.

### List box with tk2listbox()

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tcltk2)

win1 <- tktoplevel()
win1$env$lst <- tk2listbox(win1, height = 4, selectmode = "single")
tkgrid(tk2label(win1, text = "What's your favorite fruit?", justify = "left"),
  padx = 10, pady =c(15, 5), sticky = "w")
tkgrid(win1$env$lst, padx = 10, pady = c(5, 10))
fruits <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Pear", "Apricot")
for (fruit in fruits)
  tkinsert(win1$env$lst, "end", fruit)
# Default fruit is Banana.  Indexing starts at zero.
tkselection.set(win1$env$lst, 2)

onOK <- function() {
  fruitChoice <- fruits[as.numeric(tkcurselection(win1$env$lst)) + 1]
  tkdestroy(win1)
  msg <- paste0("Good choice! ", fruitChoice, "s are delicious!")
  tkmessageBox(message = msg)
}
win1$env$butOK <-tk2button(win1, text = "OK", width = -6, command = onOK)
tkgrid(win1$env$butOK, padx = 10, pady = c(5, 15))
```

The code above produces the following window:

![listbox simple]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox.png)

The user can then select their favorite fruit with the mouse:

![listbox simple selected]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox2.png)

![listbox simple OK]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox3.png)

The `tk2listbox()` function automatically adds a scrollbar. With the **tcltk** version (`tklistbox()`), you have to add it manually yourself and it requires much more code for the same result. The `tk2listbox()` function also eases the initial filling of the list and the preselection of items, as it will be done in the second example here under.


### Prefilling of a list and deletion of items from a list

Here is a multiple selection list that is prefilled:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
win2 <- tktoplevel()
tkgrid(tk2label(win2, text = "Please delete the fruit(s) which you don't like.",
  wraplength = 200, justify = "left"),
  padx = 10, pady = c(15, 5), sticky = "w", columnspan = 2)
# Note that 'selection' uses indices starting at 1, like R and not Tcl/Tk!
win2$env$lst <- tk2listbox(win2,
  values <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Pear"),
  selection = 3, height = 4, selectmode = "extended")
tkgrid(win2$env$lst, padx = 10, pady = c(5, 10), sticky = "ew", columnspan = 2)

onDelete <- function() {
  fruitsSel <- as.integer(tkcurselection(win2$env$lst))
  # Warning! We have to delete elements from bottom to top, otherwise
  # as soon as we delete an element in the front of the list, the indices
  # of the remaining items are shifted!
  for (i in rev(fruitsSel))
    tkdelete(win2$env$lst, i)
}
win2$env$butDel <- tk2button(win2, text = "Delete", width = -6,
  command = onDelete)

onOK <- function() {
  fruitsRemaining <- as.character(tkget(win2$env$lst, 0, "end"))
  tkdestroy(win2)
  if (!length(fruitsRemaining)) {
    msg <- "Oh no! You don't like fruits at all, isn't it?"
  } else {
    msg <- paste0("So, you do like these fruits: ",
      paste(fruitsRemaining, collapse = ", "))
  }
  tkmessageBox(message = msg)  
}
win2$env$butOK <-tk2button(win2, text = "OK ", width = -6, command = onOK)

tkgrid(win2$env$butDel, win2$env$butOK, padx = 10, pady = c(10, 15))
```

Running the code above gives the following window:

![listbox delete]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox4.png)

Select "Orange" from the list, then press `<Ctrl>` key and select "Pear". You got a multiple selection:

![listbox delete sel]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox5.png)

Click `Delete` to remove these fruits from the list.

![listbox deleted item]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox6.png)

Click `OK` to get this message:

![listbox remaining items]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/listbox7.png)
