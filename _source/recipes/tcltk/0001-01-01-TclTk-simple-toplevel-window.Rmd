The primary goal of the **tcltk** R package is to use the Tk graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit with R. Here is a Tk window with an `OK` button that just destroys the window when it is clicked:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Import the tcltk package
library(tcltk)
# Create a new Tk toplevel window assigned to win1
win1 <- tktoplevel()
# Create a Tk button whose function (command) is to destroy the window win1
butOK <- tkbutton(win1, text = "OK",
  command = function() tkdestroy(win1))
# Place the button on the window, using the grid geometry manager
tkgrid(butOK)
```

You should get the following window:

Click `OK` to close the window

Note that a Tk widget is not placed automatically inside its container[^1]. You have to use one of the three Tk geometry managers (_grid_, _pack_ or _place_, using respectively the **tcltk** functions `tkgrid()`, `tkpack()` and `tkplace()` in R)[^2]. The _grid_ manager is the most powerful and the most used one. It devides the container into a grid of rows and columns, arranges nicely the widgets in the grid, and then automatically resizes the container to best match its content (resulting here in a shrinked small window around the `OK` button).

[^1]: A container is a widget that can contain other widgets. A toplevel window like `win1` is a container, while `butOK` is not.

[^2]: Never mix Tk managers inside the same container!

Our Tk window and the way we manage it is indeed far from optimal. It can be ameliorated in four ways:

1. It would be nice to give a title to our Tk window. This can be done using `tktitle()`.

2. We could use **ttk** instead of **tk** widgets by replacing `tkbutton()` by `ttkbutton()`. The **ttk** widgets are styled according to a theme that makes your GUI look better, more modern, and sometimes more native (on Windows, for instance).

3. We should think about the size of the widgets and margins around them for a better layout. Our tiny `OK` button in the middle of a small window is not that nice. So, let's improve this.

4. It is nice to keep track of our Tk windows and widgets by assigning variables, like `win1` or `butOK` here. However, these variables clutter our workspace. They also do not reflect the hierarchy. `butOK` is embedded in `win1` at the Tk level. It makes clean up more difficult once the window is destroyed: you must get rid of both `win1` **and** `butOK` to free memory from items that are not needed any more. Finally, if you have two windows, each with an `OK` button, you should of course not call them both `butOK`. Also, reassigning `win1` before the first window is destroyed leads to problems[^3]. With a more complex GUI, you easily end up with dozens of variables to keep track of your Tk widgets, and you may be at risk for clashes and hard-to-debug behaviour!

[^3]: Rerun the previous code to recreate the window and the button. Do not close that window, but rerun `win1 <- tktoplevel()`. This will create a new window, as `win1`. Now, when you click the `OK` button on the _first_ window, it is the _second_ window that is destroyed!

### A better approach

Here is an improved version that implements all four points raised here above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tcltk)
win2 <- tktoplevel()
# Give a title to the window
tktitle(win2) <- "Tk window"
# Create a Ttk button with a minimum size (note negative value) of six characters
# The command is a lot more complicated to make it survive a reassignation to win2
# (explanation is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial)
# Assign inside win2 to avoid the inflation of variables in the global environment
# We assign to win2$env, instead of win2$, so that butOK is available to all
# shared versions of win1 (need further explanation!)
win2$env$butOK <- ttkbutton(win2, text = "OK", width = -6,
  command = (function(win) { force(win); function() tkdestroy(win)})(win2))
# Place the button on the window, with large margins around it
tkgrid(win2$env$butOK, padx = 70, pady = 30)
```

The button has now much more space around it. On Windows, it looks native, but on Linux it is still looking old-fashioned...

Our code is now becoming quite complicated. However, the **tcltk2** package would be helpful here.

### The tcltk2 version

The **tcltk2** R package[^4] provides more advanced Tk widgets, additional R-Tcl commands, more modern themes for Linux and Mac OS X and it simplifies the creation of GUI items. Here is how you could get the same window using **tcltk2**:

[^4]: Install the package from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org) with the instruction `install.packages("tcltk2")`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT WORK YET WITH THE VERSION OF TCLTK2 AVAILABLE ON CRAN
library(tcltk2)
# You can configure the window at creation. If you specify a manager, it will be
# automatically used for each child widget created, unless specified otherwise
win3 <- tk2toplevel(title = "Tk2 window", manage = "grid", padx = 70, pady = 30)
# Create and place the same button (note the simpler syntax)
win3$butOK <- tk2button(text = "OK", width = -6, command = TkCmd_destroy(parent))
```

The default theme on Linux is `clearlooks`, which gives the next visual:
