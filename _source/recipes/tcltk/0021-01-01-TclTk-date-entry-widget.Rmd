### The Date Entry Widget

A basic date entry widget is available in the **tcltk2** package. Here is how you can use it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tcltk2)

win1 <- tktoplevel()

# The variable that will contain my date
mydate <- tclVar()

# Use the datefiled widget (+ a label)
tclRequire("datefield")
win1$env$date <- tkwidget(win1, "datefield::datefield",
  textvariable = mydate) #, text = "11/23/2010")
tkgrid(tk2label(win1, text = "Enter a date:"), win1$env$date,
  padx = 10, pady = 10)

# Initialize it at 11/24/2010 (MM/DD/YYYY)
tclvalue(mydate) <- "11/24/2010"

# Use an OK button to get the date
onOK <- function() {
  tkdestroy(win1)
    print(as.Date(tclvalue(mydate), format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
}
win1$env$butOK <- tk2button(win1, text = "OK", width = -6, command = onOK)
tkgrid(win1$env$butOK, columnspan = 2, pady = 15)
tkbind(win1$env$date, "<Return>", onOK)
tkfocus(win1$env$date)
```

The code above produces the following date entry widget:

![date entry widget]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/date.png)

It does not let the user modify the slashes, only the numbers. It also ensures that the month is between 1 and 12 inclusive and that the day is between 1 and the number of days for that month, e.g. 31 for January. The date format is in `MM/DD/YYYY` (and unfortunatelly cannot be modified). Change the date:

![date entry widget modified]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/date2.png)

... then hit `<Enter>` or click the `OK` button, and you got:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## [1] "1999-05-15"
```


### The Calendar Widget

_Note: this has not been edited yet from the original form_

This example was provided by Dirk Eddelbuettel.

The calendar widget displays the current date and allows the user to click on a date to select it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tcltk2)
tclRequire("Iwidgets")
tt <- tktoplevel()
cal <- tkwidget(tt, "iwidgets::calendar")
tkconfigure(cal, command = function(...) cat(tclvalue(tkget(cal))))
tkpack(cal)
```

(This example was run on July 23rd). Clicking on July 1 gives:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## <Tcl>
## 07/01/2003
```
