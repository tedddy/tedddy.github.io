The following example makes window `win1` the active window.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
win1 <- tktoplevel() # A created windows is automatically focused
```

![a focused Tk window]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/focus.png)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
win2 <- tktoplevel() # Now the focus is on win2
```

![a new focused Tk window]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/focus2.png)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tkraise(win1)        # Reclaim the focus on win1
```

![refocus on the first window]({{ site.images }}/recipes-tcltk/focus3.png)
