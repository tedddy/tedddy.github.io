**[Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk)** (Tool Command Language) is a dynamic scripting language that is easily embedded in other applications. **[Tk](http://www.tkdocs.com)** is a cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. Both are useable from within R thanks to the [tcltk package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tcltk/html/tcltk-package.html). The Tk toolkit is a decent one, but not the most feature-rich. However, the big advantage of Tcl/Tk is its wide availability in all platforms supported by R: the package is maintained by the R Core Team, and it is shipped with R itself. To check if Tcl/Tk is available, use the command `capabilities("tcltk")`.

The [tcltk2]() package is also available from [CRAN](). It offers additional possibilities and more widgets. These recipes show how to use both the tcltk and the tcltk2 packages with R to build a GUI, or to use other potentials of Tcl.

## Other sources of R tcltk help/examples

1. Run `help.start()` in R to get HTML help, then click on `Packages`, then click on `tcltk` or `tcltk2`.

2. Read the [ActiveTcl help](http://docs.activestate.com/activetcl/8.6/full_toc.html) and learn how to convert Tcl options to R arguments, e.g.
    
    ```
    -background white
    ```
    
    becomes in R
    
    ```
    background = "white"
    ```

3. Read Peter Dalgaard's articles in Rnews : [Rnews 2001, Vol. 3](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf) and [Rnews 2002, Vol. 3](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2002-3.pdf).

4. Study the demos in the R `tcltk` package, e.g. `tkdensity` and `tkttest`.

5. Read and participate in [R-Help](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html) and other R mailing lists.

6. Search the web for Tcl/Tk examples, and don't ignore them completely if they use a language other than R, e.g. Perl or Python. A lot can be learned from these examples.
